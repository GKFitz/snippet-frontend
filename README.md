##Title 
Gillian's Code Cache App

## Description
This mern application is my fun and straightforward way of keeping track of the helpful bits of code I have come accross in the last couple months. Using MongoDB/Mongoose Databases I can create Directories that house and organize my helpful code "snippets", and display them in an organized mutilayered fashion, utilizing React router single page development capabilities. When I access the app, I am immediately shown the different directories I have previously created, and I am offered the opportunity to create more. When I click on one of these directories, I am navigated to a page that comtains a "snipp" version of the snippets I previously created. This Snip version shows the title and is organized in the order in which I the user created it. I can from this directory landing page then create a new Snippet enrty, edit existing snippet entries or delete a snippet altogether. If I click on a snippet directly, I will be navigated to the snippet detail page which will not only display the title, but the piece of code I wanted to document, the snippet description about what that code does, and any othe articles or possible info I want ed to add about the codes usefulness.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
